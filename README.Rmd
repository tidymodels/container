The goal of tailor is to provide a tailor for postprocessing.

This is going to undergo massive changes (especially the name), so please treat it as experimental and don't depend on the syntax staying the same.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tailor like so:

``` r
pak::pak("tidymodels/tailor")
```
