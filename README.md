The goal of container is to provide a container for postprocessing.

This is going to undergo massive changes (especially the name), so
please treat it as experimental and donâ€™t depend on the syntax staying
the same.

## Installation

You can install the development version of container like so:

``` r
pak::pak("tidymodels/container")
```
